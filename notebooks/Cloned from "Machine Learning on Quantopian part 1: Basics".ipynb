    "# Exploring Machine Learning on Quantopian\n",
    "Recently, Quantopian’s Chief Investment Officer, Jonathan Larkin, shared an industry insider’s overview of the [professional quant equity workflow](http://blog.quantopian.com/a-professional-quant-equity-workflow/). This workflow is comprised of distinct stages including: (1) Universe Definition, (2) Alpha Discovery, (3) Alpha Combination, (4) Portfolio Construction and (5) Trading.\n",
    "\n",
    "This Notebook focuses on stage 3: Alpha Combination. At this stage, Machine Learning is an intuitive choice as we have abstracted the problem to such a degree that it is now a classic classification (or regression) problem which ML is very good at solving and coming up with an alpha combination that is predictive.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you will see, there is a lot of code here setting up a factor library and some data wrangling to get everything into shape. The details of this part are perhaps not quite as interesting so feel free to skip directly to [\"Training our ML pipeline\"](#training) where we have everything in place to train and test our classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "1. Define trading universe to use ([Q500US and Q1500US](https://www.quantopian.com/posts/the-q500us-and-q1500us)).\n",
    "2. Define alphas (implemented in [Pipeline](https://www.quantopian.com/tutorials/pipeline)).\n",
    "3. Run pipeline.\n",
    "4. Split into train and test set.\n",
    "5. Preprocess data (rank alphas, subsample, align alphas with future returns, impute, scale).\n",
    "6. Train Machine Learning classifier ([AdaBoost from Scikit-Learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.AdaBoostClassifier.html)).\n",
    "7. Evaluate Machine Learning classifier on test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that one important limitation is that we only train and test on static (i.e. fixed-in-time) data. Thus, you can not directly do the same in an algorithm. In principle, this is possible and will be the next step but it makes sense to first focus on just the ML in a more direct way to get a good intuition about the workflow and how to develop a competitive ML pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Disclaimer\n",
    "This workflow is still a bit rough around the edges. We are working on improving it and adding better educational materials. This serves as a sneak-peek for the curious and adventurous."

In essence, AdaBoost trains an ensemble of weak classifiers (decision trees in this case) sequentially. Each subsequent weak classifier takes into account the samples (or data points) already classified by the previous weak classifiers. It then focuses on the samples misclassified by the previous weak classifiers and tries to get those correctly. With each new weak classifier you get more fine-grained in your decision function and correctly classify some previously misclassified samples. For prediction, you simply average the answer of all weak classifiers to get a single strong classifier.\n",
